# Tau Labs

Welcome to Tau Labs! We are a high performance team of data scientists and engineers who are passionate about solving the world's most challenging problems with data. We are a team of 10,000+ members and we are growing every day.

In this challenge you'll be building out our assessment framework. We have a number of different assessments that we use to assess candidates and we need to be able to run these assessments and store the results.

## Assessment Criteria

You will be assessed on three different metrics

1. The number of passing tests when run with `pytest` (90% of your score)
2. Your `pylint` code quality score (10% of your score)
3. Discretionary marks from coaches (can be any amount between -20% and +20%)

## Setup

Please ensure you do every step below carefully. Not doing so will mean we can't assess your work and **will result in a score of zero**.

1. Ensure you have followed all setup instructions on the curriculum
2. Before running your code, run this command

> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Files Explained

In each of the `Level` folders you will find the code and instructions for that level. **Each level will build on the one before it**; be sure to read the instructions carefully.

- `task_[level].py` - All of your code should be written in this file.
- `test_[level]_task.py` - This file contains some basic tasks for this level.
- `README.md` - This file contains the instructions for the level.
